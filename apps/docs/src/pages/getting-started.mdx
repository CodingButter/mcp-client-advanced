# üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will help you get up and running with the Advanced MCP Client quickly and efficiently.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **PNPM** - Package manager (recommended)
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

```bash
# Check your versions
node --version  # Should be 18+
pnpm --version  # Latest stable
git --version   # Any recent version
```

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/advanced-mcp-client.git
cd advanced-mcp-client
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies across the monorepo
pnpm install
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
# Build all packages and applications
pnpm build
```

### 4. Start the Client

```bash
# Start in development mode
pnpm dev

# Or start the built CLI
pnpm cli
```

## üéØ Your First Parallel Execution

Let's run your first parallel tool execution to see the Advanced MCP Client in action:

### Example: Morning Briefing

This example demonstrates how multiple information sources are gathered concurrently:

```bash
# Start the CLI
pnpm cli

# In the CLI, enter:
> brief morning
```

**What happens:**
1. **Weather Service** - Gets current conditions
2. **Calendar API** - Fetches today's schedule  
3. **Email Service** - Summarizes new messages
4. **News API** - Gets relevant headlines

All of these run **simultaneously** instead of one after another!

### Traditional vs Parallel Execution

    subgraph "Traditional Sequential"
        A1[Weather] --> A2[Calendar] --> A3[Email] --> A4[News]
        A4 --> A5[Response after 12s]
    end
    
    subgraph "Advanced Parallel"
        B1[Weather] 
        B2[Calendar]
        B3[Email]
        B4[News]
        B1 --> B5[Response after 4s]
        B2 --> B5
        B3 --> B5
        B4 --> B5
    end

## üé® Terminal Interface Overview

The Advanced MCP Client features a rich terminal interface with multiple panes:

### Main Interface Components

- **Governor View** - Shows the Central Governor's current strategy and decisions
- **Task Execution View** - Live DAG visualization of running tasks
- **Context Inspector** - Shared context and session information
- **Command Input** - Interactive command interface

### Essential Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Show system status and active tasks |
| `/governor` | Access Central Governor controls |
| `/threads` | View thread pool status |
| `/schedule` | Manage scheduled tasks |
| `/help` | Show all available commands |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Create a configuration file at `~/.mcp-client/config.json`:

```json
{
  "threads": {
    "maxConcurrent": 8,
    "poolSize": 16
  },
  "governor": {
    "optimizationMode": "balanced",
    "maxRetries": 3
  },
  "ui": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "showProgress": true
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for external service integration:

```bash
# LLM Configuration
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"

# External Services
export WEATHER_API_KEY="your-weather-key"
export GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS="path/to/credentials.json"
```

### Server Mode

To run the client in server mode with web interface:

```bash
# Start the server
pnpm server

# Access web interface at http://localhost:3001
```

## üîç Verification

Verify your installation is working correctly:

### 1. Check System Status

```bash
pnpm cli status
```

Should show:
- ‚úÖ Governor Service: Active
- ‚úÖ Thread Pool: 8/16 threads available
- ‚úÖ MCP Protocol: Connected
- ‚úÖ Context Store: Ready

### 2. Run Health Check

```bash
pnpm cli health
```

### 3. Test Parallel Execution

```bash
# This should complete much faster than sequential execution
pnpm cli demo parallel
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
pnpm clean
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

**Permission Errors**
```bash
# On Unix systems, you may need to set execute permissions
chmod +x ./apps/cli/bin/mcp-cli
```

**Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Change server port in configuration
export MCP_SERVER_PORT=3002
```
